Modify the class definition from above to facilitate the following methods. 
Note that there is no name= setter method now.

bob = Person.new('Robert')
bob.name                  # => 'Robert'
bob.first_name            # => 'Robert'
bob.last_name             # => ''
bob.last_name = 'Smith'
bob.name                  # => 'Robert Smith'

Hint: let first_name and last_name be "states" and create an instance method called name that 
uses those states.
